#  :bulb: ColorSense - Real-time (:camera:) Color Recognition  and HSV Color Picker 

#  Over view 
ColorSense is a versatile Python project that combines real-time color recognition with an interactive HSV color picker. With ColorSense, you can easily identify and display colors captured by your webcam and explore the HSV color space.

# Color Recognition 
The Color Recognition module in ColorSense allows you to use your webcam to detect and display the color of objects brought near it. The center pointer on the screen indicates the area being analyzed, and the recognized color is displayed as the text color.

# HSV Color Picker 
The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) Color Picker in ColorSense provides an interactive way to explore the HSV color space. You can adjust the Hue, Saturation, and Value sliders to create and visualize different colors. This feature is particularly useful for color selection and experimentation.
